# Uses System-Bus-Radio to broadcast keyboard presses. SBR keylogger.

*Proof-of-concept*

I found a research project by called [System Bus Radio](https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio) from fulldecent where William would play "Mary had a little lamb" over SBR.

His project is written in C and if you have any interest in SDR, HAM stuff or terminal whispering please go check out [his research](ttps://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio).

I was experimenting with a keylogging on Mac OSX El Capitan, so I came up with this small POC.

It took me a couple hours to put this project together, so your imagination is actually what is possible for this POC.
